  <b> <p class="text-center">10 Things You Didn’t Know About DR.B.R.AMBEDKAR:</p></b>
  <ul>
    <li>Leader of the Dalits (Scheduled Castes; formerly called untouchables) and law minister of the government of India (1947–51).</li>
    <li>Born of a Dalit Mahar family of western India, he was as a boy humiliated by his high-caste schoolfellows.</li>
     <li>His father was an officer in the Indian army. Awarded a scholarship by the Gaekwar (ruler) of Baroda (now Vadodara).
    </li>
     <li>He studied at universities in the United States, Britain, and Germany. He entered the Baroda Public Service at the Gaekwar’s request, but, again ill-treated by his high-caste colleagues, he turned to legal practice and to teaching.</li>
     <li>He soon established his leadership among Dalits, founded several journals on their behalf, and succeeded in obtaining special representation for them in the legislative councils of the government. 
    </li>
     <li>Contesting Mahatma Gandhi’s claim to speak for Dalits (or Harijans, as Gandhi called them), he wrote What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (1945).
    </li>
      <li>In 1947 Ambedkar became the law minister of the government of India.
    </li>
   <li>He took a leading part in the framing of the Indian constitution, outlawing discrimination against untouchables, and skillfully helped to steer it through the assembly. 
    </li>
   <li>He resigned in 1951, disappointed at his lack of influence in the government.
    </li>
   <li>In October 1956, in despair because of the perpetuation of untouchability in Hindu doctrine, he renounced Hinduism and became a Buddhist, together with about 200,000 fellow Dalits, at a ceremony in Nagpur.
    </li>
